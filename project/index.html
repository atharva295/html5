		<p>
			Ligament, tough fibrous band of connective tissue that serves to support the internal organs and hold bones together in proper articulation at the joints. A ligament is composed of dense fibrous bundles of collagenous fibres and spindle-shaped cells known as fibrocytes, with little ground substance (a gel-like component of the various connective tissues). Ligaments may be of two major types: white ligament is rich in collagenous fibres, which are sturdy and inelastic; and yellow ligament is rich in elastic fibres, which are quite tough even though they allow elastic movement. At joints, ligaments form a capsular sac that encloses the articulating bone ends and a lubricating membrane, the synovial membrane. Sometimes the structure includes a recess, or pouch, lined by synovial tissue; this is called a bursa. Other ligaments fasten around or across bone ends in bands, permitting varying degrees of movement, or act as tie pieces between bones (such as the ribs or the bones of the forearm), restricting inappropriate movement.

						Tone of Surrounding Muscles
			The tone of the surrounding muscles contributes greatly to the stability of a joint. A good example of this is the support provided by the rotator cuff muscles, which keep the head of the humerus in the shallow glenoid cavity of the scapula. If there is a loss of tone, such as in old age or stroke, the shoulder can dislocate.
			Dislocations of the shoulder joint can tear the rotator cuff muscles, making the patient more susceptible to further injuries.
			Similarly, the tone of muscles around the knee are crucial to its stability. Through inappropriate or unbalanced training, the knee can be made prone to injury through muscle imbalance. This can lead to chronic pain.
